A spam bot is a computer program or script that automatically and repeatedly sends messages, emails, or other digital communications. It can be used for various purposes including:

Advertising and Marketing: A spam bot can send bulk emails or text messages to a large number of recipients to promote products, services, or websites.
Social media spam: On platforms such as Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, a spam bot can automatically post comments, likes or messages to draw attention to specific content.
Fraud and phishing: Some spam bots are malicious and attempt to steal personal information or trick users into fraudulent activities.
Search engine spam: Spam bots can automatically leave links to websites in forums, blogs or comments to manipulate search engine rankings.
Chat spam: In chat platforms like WhatsApp or Discord, spam bots can automatically send messages to flood chat history.
It's important to note that spam bots are often unwanted and, in many cases, violate platforms' terms of service. Therefore, their use should be done with caution and ethical guidelines should be followed. ðŸ¤–ðŸ“§
